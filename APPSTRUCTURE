# WOL-MANAGER APPLICATION STRUCTURE

## 1. Application Architecture Overview

### Factory Pattern Implementation
The application uses the factory pattern in `app/__init__.py` to create the Flask application instance:
- Creates a configurable application instance using `create_app()`
- Initializes extensions (SQLAlchemy, Login Manager, Migrate, etc.)
- Registers blueprints for modular organization
- Sets up error handlers and logging

### Blueprint Structure
The application is organized into several blueprints:
- **Auth Blueprint** (`app/auth.py`): Handles user authentication, registration, password management
- **Host Blueprint** (`app/host.py`): Manages network device information and operations
- **WOL Blueprint** (`app/wol.py`): Implements Wake-on-LAN functionality
- **Main Blueprint**: Manages main routes and application flow
- **Admin Blueprint**: Handles administrative functions and settings

### SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation
- Uses SQLAlchemy with scoped sessions for database operations
- Models defined in `app/models.py`
- Session management handled in the application factory
- Leverages Flask-Migrate for database migrations (managed via `manage.py`)
- Raw SQL queries implemented using SQLAlchemy text() function:
  - Imported via `from sqlalchemy import text`
  - All raw SQL statements wrapped with text() function: `db_session.execute(text("SELECT 1"))`
  - Prevents SQLAlchemy warnings and ensures proper SQL escaping
  - Used in database integrity checks and complex queries where ORM is insufficient

### Flask-Login Integration
- User authentication through Flask-Login extension
- User loader function defined in `app/__init__.py`
- Session management and authentication state tracking
- Login/logout functionality implemented in auth blueprint

### Role-Permission Hierarchy
- Many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions using association tables
- Users have roles which grant specific permissions
- Permission checking implemented for route access control
- Role-based visibility filtering for hosts

## 2. Core Components Analysis

### Model Relationships (ERD)
```
User (1) <-----> (M) Role (M) <-----> (M) Permission
  |
  | (1)
  v
 (M)
Host (1) <-----> (M) Log
```

#### Key Models:
- **User**: Authentication, profile data, role assignments
- **Role**: Named permission groups (Admin, User, etc.)
- **Permission**: Granular access controls
- **Host**: Network device information (MAC address, IP, name)
- **Log**: Record of WOL operations and system events
- **AuthEvent**: Record of authentication attempts, successes, failures, and logouts
- **AdminSettings**: System-wide configuration options

### WOL Packet Generation
- Implemented in `app/wol.py`
- Creates magic packets with 6 bytes of 0xFF followed by 16 repetitions of target MAC address
- Sends packets via UDP to broadcast address on port 9
- Includes MAC address validation and formatting
- Implements rate limiting for security
### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Credentials validated against database (password hashed with bcrypt)
3. Authentication attempt logged to database with timestamp, IP address, and user agent
4. User session created with Flask-Login if authentication successful
5. Role and permissions attached to session
6. Authentication result (success/failure) logged with detailed information
7. Redirected to appropriate page based on role/permissions
5. Redirected to appropriate page based on role/permissions

### Host Visibility Rules
- Hosts filtered based on user roles and permissions
- Admin users can see all hosts
- Regular users see only hosts they've created or have been granted access to
- Visibility controlled at database query level and through template conditions

### AdminSettings Configuration
- System-wide settings managed through AdminSettings model
- Only accessible to users with admin role
- Configuration changes logged for audit trail
- Settings affect application behavior (e.g., rate limits, log retention)

## 3. Implementation Deep Dive

### Configuration Class Hierarchy
```
BaseConfig
  ├── DevelopmentConfig
  ├── TestingConfig
  └── ProductionConfig
```
- Configuration inheritance pattern in `app/config.py`
- Environment variables used for sensitive configuration
- Different settings for development, testing, and production environments

### Migration Workflow
- Database migrations managed via Flask-Migrate
- Commands implemented in `manage.py`:
  - `db init`: Initialize migration repository
  - `db migrate`: Generate migration script
  - `db upgrade`: Apply migrations to database
  - `db downgrade`: Revert migrations
- Migration scripts stored in migrations directory

### Session Management
- **Redis Backend**: Uses Redis for centralized session storage
  - Ensures consistent session data across multiple worker processes
  - Improves scalability and reliability in multi-worker environments
  - Allows for distributed deployment with shared session state
  - Falls back to filesystem sessions when Redis is unavailable
- Flask-Login handles user authentication state
- Remember-me functionality implemented
- Session security features:
  - Secure cookies (HTTPS only in production)
  - HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access
  - Enhanced cookie parameters for external deployments
  - Strengthened session validation mechanisms
  - Configurable session lifetime (currently 1 day)
- Session timeout and refresh mechanisms

### Security Measures
- **CSRF Protection**: Implemented in forms using Flask-WTF's CSRF protection
  - Consistent CSRF secret key shared across all worker processes
  - One-hour token validity period via WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT
  - Dedicated error handler with user-friendly messages
  - Token generation using 24-byte cryptographically secure keys
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt used for secure password storage in `app/auth.py`
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented for WOL routes to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: WTForms validation on all user inputs
- **Permission Checks**: Authorization checks before sensitive operations
- **Authentication Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of authentication events via `app/auth_logger.py`
  - Records login attempts, successes, failures, and logouts
  - Stores IP addresses and user agents for security analysis
  - Database-backed for persistent audit trail
  - Used for security monitoring and troubleshooting

### Docker Architecture
- **Multi-container Setup**:
  - Web service: Flask application with Gunicorn workers
  - Redis service: Session storage and caching
- **Multi-stage Build**: Optimized Docker image size via multi-stage build
- **Volume Persistence**:
  - Database stored in a persistent volume
  - Logs and user-generated content persisted across container restarts
  - Redis data optionally persisted for session continuity
- **Entrypoint Initialization**:
  - `entrypoint.sh` handles database initialization and migration
  - Waits for database to be available before starting the application
  - Creates initial admin user if it doesn't exist
  - Database initialization workflow:
    * Checks if database file exists at `/app/instance/wol.db`
    * If not present, executes initialization sequence: 
      1. `python manage.py init-db` - Creates database schema
      2. `python manage.py create-permissions` - Sets up default permissions
      3. `python manage.py create-admin` - Creates admin user (WOLadmin/Manager)
    * For existing databases, runs migrations via `python manage.py db-upgrade`
    * Uses persistent Docker volume (`db_data:/app/instance`) to maintain database across restarts
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment variables used for configuration
  - REDIS_URL for session storage connection
  - WTF_CSRF_SECRET_KEY for consistent CSRF token generation
  - Separate configuration for development, testing, and production environments
- **Network Configuration**:
  - **Host Network Mode**: Required for Wake-on-LAN functionality
    * Uses `network_mode: "host"` in docker-compose.yml for the web service
    * Provides direct access to UDP port 9 used by WoL magic packets
    * Allows broadcasting packets to the physical network (255.255.255.255)
    * Bypasses Docker's NAT which would otherwise block broadcast packets
  - **Default Bridge Network Limitations**:
    * Standard bridge mode isolates containers from the host network
    * Broadcast packets (255.255.255.255) cannot reach physical network devices
    * Even with exposed UDP port 9, NAT interferes with broadcast packet distribution
  - **Redis Configuration**:
    * Redis remains in bridge network mode with exposed port
    * Web service connects to Redis via localhost when in host network mode

## 4. Data Flow Documentation

### WOL Request Processing Sequence
```
1. User Request -> 2. Authentication Check -> 3. Permission Verification ->
4. Host Validation -> 5. Packet Generation -> 6. Network Transmission -> 7. Logging
```

### Role Resolution Algorithm
1. User's roles retrieved from database
2. Roles mapped to corresponding permissions
3. Permission sets merged to create comprehensive permission list
4. User's effective permissions cached in session
5. Permission checks performed against this cache

### Host Filtering Process
1. User roles determined at login
2. Database queries include role-based filters
3. Query results filtered based on user's permissions
4. Templates render only authorized content
5. Additional checks performed before sensitive operations

### Log Storage and Retrieval
1. Operations logged to database with timestamp, user, and action details
2. Logs retrievable by admins for audit purposes
3. Log retention policy applied based on configuration
4. Log entries associated with relevant model objects (User, Host)

### Authentication Event Logging
1. All authentication events captured in database (login attempts, successes, failures, logouts)
2. Records include timestamp, username, IP address, and user agent information
3. Provides comprehensive audit trail for security monitoring
4. Helps identify suspicious login patterns and potential security threats

## 6. Development Workflow (Docker Development)

### Local Development
1. Clone repository
2. Set up virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Configure environment variables
5. Initialize database
6. Run development server

### Docker Development Best Practices
1. **Source Code Changes Only**: Always make changes to the source code, never to a running Docker container
2. **Rebuild Containers**: After making code changes, build a new Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t wol-manager:latest .
   ```
3. **Clean Test Environment**: Run containers from the new image:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. **Reproducible Development**: This approach ensures changes are tracked, versioned, and reproducible
5. **Container Immutability**: Preserves the immutable nature of containers as designed
6. **Test and Validate**: Test your changes in the newly built container
7. **Iterate**: Repeat the process as necessary during development

### Deployment Process
1. Build Docker image
2. Configure environment variables
3. Start containers using Docker Compose
4. Access application via web browser
5. Monitor logs for issues

### Update Process
